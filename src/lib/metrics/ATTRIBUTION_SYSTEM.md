# Attribution System Documentation

## 🎯 Overview

The Attribution System solves the **role attribution confusion** that was causing issues like "43 (28 setter + 15 rep)" displays. It provides clear, single-attribution metrics that eliminate double-counting and make it obvious who gets credit for what.

## 🚨 The Problem We Solved

**Before:** Confusing displays where users with multiple roles were double-counted:
- `Total Appointments: 43 (28 setter + 15 rep)` ← Confusing!
- Unclear whether you're measuring who booked vs who was assigned
- Double-counting users who have both setter and rep roles

**After:** Clear, single-attribution metrics:
- `Total Appointments (Assigned): 15` ← Clear: assigned to sales reps
- `Total Appointments (Booked): 28` ← Clear: booked by setters
- No double-counting, no confusion

## 📊 Attribution Contexts

### 1. **Assigned** (`assigned`)
- **Field**: `sales_rep_user_id` 
- **Meaning**: Who was assigned to handle this record
- **Use Cases**: Sales rep performance, assigned workload
- **Badge**: 👤 Assigned

### 2. **Booked** (`booked`)
- **Field**: `setter_user_id`
- **Meaning**: Who booked/created this record
- **Use Cases**: Setter performance, booking activity
- **Badge**: 📅 Booked

### 3. **Dialer** (`dialer`)
- **Field**: `setter_user_id` (for dials only)
- **Meaning**: Who made the dial
- **Use Cases**: Dial activity, call performance
- **Badge**: 📞 Dialer

## 🗂️ Table-Specific Attribution

### **Appointments**
- **Assigned** = `sales_rep_user_id` (who handles the appointment)
- **Booked** = `setter_user_id` (who booked the appointment)

### **Discoveries** 
- **Assigned** = `setter_user_id` (who is assigned to the discovery)
- **Booked** = `sales_rep_user_id` (sales rep it was booked for)

### **Dials**
- **Dialer** = `setter_user_id` (who made the dial)
- No other attributions (dials don't have sales_rep_user_id)

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Metric Definition**
```typescript
{
  name: 'Total Appointments (Assigned)',
  attributionContext: 'assigned', // 👈 This determines attribution
  query: { table: 'appointments', select: ['COUNT(*) as value'] }
}
```

### 2. **UserMetricsEngine Processing**
- Detects `attributionContext` in metric definition
- Routes to `processSingleAttributionResults()` 
- Attributes each record to exactly one user based on context
- No double-counting, no confusion

### 3. **UI Display**
- Metrics grouped by attribution context
- Clear category labels: "📅 Appointments (Assigned)"
- Attribution badges on each metric
- Legacy metrics separated into "⚠️ Legacy Metrics"

## 🚀 Future-Proof System

### **Automatic Generation**
```typescript
import { createMetricFamily } from '@/lib/metrics/attribution-generator'

// Define base metric once
const baseMetric = {
  name: 'New Metric',
  description: 'Description',
  query: { table: 'appointments', select: ['COUNT(*) as value'] },
  unit: 'count'
}

// Automatically generates all variants:
const metrics = createMetricFamily('new_metric', baseMetric)
// Creates: new_metric_assigned, new_metric_booked, new_metric (legacy)
```

### **Smart Attribution Detection**
- Automatically determines applicable attributions based on table
- `appointments` + `discoveries` → `assigned` + `booked`
- `dials` → `dialer` only
- Other tables → no attribution (legacy behavior)

## 📋 Complete Metric Coverage

### ✅ **COVERED (with attribution context)**
- Total Appointments (Assigned/Booked)
- Show Ups (Assigned/Booked)
- Discoveries (Assigned/Booked)
- Sales Made (Assigned/Booked)
- Cash Collected (Assigned/Booked)
- Cash Per Appointment (Assigned/Booked)
- Appointment to Sale Rate (Assigned/Booked)
- Pitch to Sale Rate (Assigned/Booked)
- Answer to Sale Rate (Assigned/Booked)
- Cash Per Sale (Assigned/Booked)
- Total Dials (Dialer)
- Cash Per Dial (Dialer)

### ⚠️ **LEGACY (deprecated but functional)**
- Old combined metrics without attribution context
- Still work for backward compatibility
- Marked as "Legacy Metrics" in UI

## 🎨 UI Experience

### **Metric Selection Modal**
```
📅 Appointments (Assigned)
├── Total Appointments (Assigned) [👤 Assigned] [Count]
├── Show Ups (Assigned) [👤 Assigned] [Count]
└── Appointment to Sale (Assigned) [👤 Assigned] [Percentage]

📋 Appointments (Booked)  
├── Total Appointments (Booked) [📅 Booked] [Count]
├── Show Ups (Booked) [📅 Booked] [Count]
└── Appointment to Sale (Booked) [📅 Booked] [Percentage]

⚠️ Legacy Metrics
├── Total Appointments [Count] ← No attribution context
└── Show Ups (Appointments) [Count] ← Confusing old version
```

### **Data Table Display**
- **Before**: `David Bitondo: 43 (28 setter + 15 rep)` ← Confusing!
- **After**: 
  - `Total Appointments (Assigned): 15` ← Clear!
  - `Total Appointments (Booked): 28` ← Clear!

## 🔮 Adding New Metrics (Future-Proof)

### **Option 1: Manual (Current Method)**
```typescript
// Add to registry.ts
'my_new_metric_assigned': {
  name: 'My New Metric (Assigned)',
  attributionContext: 'assigned',
  // ... rest of definition
},
'my_new_metric_booked': {
  name: 'My New Metric (Booked)', 
  attributionContext: 'booked',
  // ... rest of definition
}
```

### **Option 2: Automatic (Recommended)**
```typescript
// Use the attribution generator
import { createMetricFamily } from '@/lib/metrics/attribution-generator'

const newMetrics = createMetricFamily('my_new_metric', {
  name: 'My New Metric',
  description: 'What this metric measures',
  query: { table: 'appointments', select: ['COUNT(*) as value'] },
  unit: 'count'
})

// Automatically creates:
// - my_new_metric_assigned (👤 Assigned)
// - my_new_metric_booked (📅 Booked)  
// - my_new_metric (legacy)
```

### **Option 3: Batch Creation**
```typescript
import { createMetricFamilies } from '@/lib/metrics/attribution-generator'

const baseMetrics = {
  'metric_one': { /* definition */ },
  'metric_two': { /* definition */ },
  'metric_three': { /* definition */ }
}

const allMetrics = createMetricFamilies(baseMetrics)
// Creates all variants for all metrics automatically
```

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### **UserMetricsEngine Tests**
- ✅ Single attribution contexts work correctly
- ✅ No double-counting of users
- ✅ Correct field mapping (assigned → sales_rep_user_id, booked → setter_user_id)
- ✅ Legacy metrics still work for backward compatibility

### **UI Tests**
- ✅ Metrics properly categorized by attribution context
- ✅ Attribution badges display correctly
- ✅ Legacy metrics separated into their own section
