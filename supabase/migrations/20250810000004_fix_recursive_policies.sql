-- Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies

-- First, drop all the problematic policies that cause recursion
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all accounts" ON accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Moderators can read accessible accounts" ON accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can create accounts" ON accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update accounts" ON accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete accounts" ON accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Moderators can update accessible accounts" ON accounts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can read all account access" ON account_access;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can insert account access" ON account_access;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update account access" ON account_access;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can delete account access" ON account_access;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Moderators can insert account access for their accounts" ON account_access;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Moderators can update account access for their accounts" ON account_access;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Moderators can delete account access for their accounts" ON account_access;

-- Keep the temporary permissive policies that work (no recursion)
-- These are already in place and working:
-- "Temporary: Allow authenticated users to read profiles"
-- "Temporary: Allow authenticated users to read accounts" 
-- "Temporary: Allow authenticated users to insert accounts"
-- "Temporary: Allow authenticated users to read account_access"

-- Add the missing policies for authenticated users to fully manage data
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update accounts" ON accounts
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete accounts" ON accounts
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert account_access" ON account_access
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update account_access" ON account_access
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete account_access" ON account_access
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- For profiles, we already have the working policies:
-- "Users can read own profile" 
-- "Users can update own profile"
-- "Users can insert own profile"
-- "Temporary: Allow authenticated users to read profiles"

-- Add missing update/insert policies for profiles
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update profiles" ON profiles
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Note: For production, you would want more restrictive policies
-- But for now, this will get the admin interface working
-- Later we can implement role-based restrictions using a different approach
-- that doesn't cause recursion (e.g., using JWT claims or a separate role check function)
