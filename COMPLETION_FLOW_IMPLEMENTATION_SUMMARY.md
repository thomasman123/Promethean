## 🔄 Data Flow

### Completion Flow:
1. User navigates to `/update-data/appointments-discoveries`
2. API fetches pending items (data_filled = false, date_booked_for ≤ now)
3. Items sorted: discoveries first, then appointments, by date
4. User completes data using keyboard or mouse
5. Data saved via `/api/appointments/outcome` or `/api/discoveries/outcome`
6. `data_filled` set to true, item removed from queue
7. Next item auto-loaded

### Overdue Notifications:
1. Component loads on mount, every 5 minutes
2. API queries items where date_booked_for < (now - 24 hours) AND data_filled = false
3. Count displayed in badge
4. Clicking notification opens completion flow

### Moderator Mode:
1. Check user has moderator/admin role for account
2. Fetch all pending items for account
3. Apply filters (user, type, overdue status)
4. Display in table with actions
5. "Complete for User" passes moderate_user_id to completion flow
6. Flow operates on behalf of selected user

### KPI System:
1. Admin/moderator creates KPI definition
2. System calculates current period dates based on period_type
3. Fetches metric data via `/api/metrics` endpoint
4. Calculates progress and status
5. Stores in `kpi_progress` table
6. Displays in widgets and KPI page
7. On period end, moves to `kpi_history`
